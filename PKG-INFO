Description: The modeltranslation application can be used to translate dynamic
             content of existing Django models to an arbitrary number of
             languages without having to change the original model classes. It
             uses a registration approach (comparable to Django's admin app) to
             be able to add translations to existing or new projects and is
             fully integrated into the Django admin backend.

             The advantage of a registration approach is the ability to add
             translations to models on a per-project basis. You can use the
             same app in different projects, may they use translations or not,
             and you never have to touch the original model class.
