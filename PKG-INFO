Description: The modeltranslation application can be used to translate dynamic
             content of existing models to an arbitrary number of languages
             without having to change the original model classes. It uses a
             registration approach (comparable to Django's admin app) to be
             able to add translations to existing or new projects and is fully
             integrated into the Django admin backend.

             The advantage of a registration approach is the ability to add
             translations to models on a per-project basis. You can use the
             same app in different projects, may they use translations or not,
             and you never have to touch the original model class.
