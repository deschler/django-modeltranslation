         (thanks to Jacek Tomaszewski,
          resolves issues #123 and #124)
  ADDED: Possibility to turn off query rewriting in MultilingualManager.
         (thanks to Jacek Tomaszewski)
CHANGED: Major test refactoring.
         (thanks to Jacek Tomaszewski,

v0.5a1
======
Date: 2012-12-05
Packaged from revision da4aeba0ea20ddbee67aa49bc90af507997ac386.

  ADDED: Increased the number of supported fields. Essentially all Django
         model fields and subclasses of them should work, except related
         fields (ForeignKey, ManyToManyField, OneToOneField) and AutoField
         which are not supported.
  ADDED: A subclass of TranslationOptions inherits fields from its bases.
         (thanks to Bruno Tavares and Jacek Tomaszewski,
          resolves issue #110)
  ADDED: Support for fallback languages. Allows fine grained configuration
         through project settings and TranslationOptions on model basis.
         (thanks to Jacek Tomaszewski,
          resolves issue #104)
  ADDED: Multilingual manager which is aware of the current language.
         (thanks to Jacek Tomaszewski,
          resolves issues #45, #78 and #84)

CHANGED: Version code to use a PEP386 compliant version number.
CHANGED: Constructor rewrites fields to be language aware.
         (thanks to Jacek Tomaszewski,
          resolves issues #33 and #58)

  FIXED: Lacking support for readonly_fields in TranslationAdmin.
         (thanks to sbrandtb,
          resolves issue #111)
  FIXED: Model's db_column option is not applied to the translation field.
         (resolves issue #83)
  FIXED: Admin prevents saving a cleared field. The fix deactivates rule3 and
         implies the new language aware manager and constructor rewrite.
         (resolves issue #85)


v0.4.1
======
Date: 2012-11-13
Packaged from revision d9bf9709e9647fb2af51fc559bbe356010bd51ca.

  FIXED: Pypi wants to install beta version. Happened because pypi treats
         0.4.0-beta2 as latest release. This also effectively resulted in a
         downgrade when using 'pip --upgrade' and 0.4.0 was already installed.
         (thanks to jmagnusson for the report,
          resolves issue #103)

v0.4.0
======
Date: 2012-11-11
Packaged from revision c44f9cfee59f1b440f022422f917f247e16bbc6b.

CHANGED: Refactored tests to allow test runs with other apps. Includes a
         "backport" of override_settings to ensure Django 1.3 support.
         (thanks to Jacek Tomaszewski)
CHANGED: Modeltranslation related css class prefix to 'mt'.

  FIXED: Race condition during initialization.
         (resolves issue #91)
  FIXED: Tabs don't properly support two-part language codes.
         (resolves issue #63)


v0.4.0-beta2
============
Date: 2012-10-17
Packaged from revision 7b8cafbde7b14afc8e85235e9b087889a6bfa86e.

  FIXED: Release doesn't include rst files.


v0.4.0-beta1
============
Date: 2012-10-17
Packaged from revision 09a0c4434a676c6fd753e6dcde95056c424db62e.

CHANGED: Refactored documentation using sphinx.
         (resolves issue #81)

  FIXED: Setting MODELTRANSLATION_TRANSLATION_FILES should be optional.
         (resolves issue #86)


v0.4.0-alpha1
=============
Date: 2012-10-12
Packaged from revision 170.

  ADDED: Support for FileField and ImageField.
         (thanks to Bruno Tavares,
          resolves issue #30)
  ADDED: New management command sync_database_fields to sync the database after
         a new model has been registered or a new language has been added.
         (thanks to Sébastien Fievet and the authors of django-transmeta,
          resolves issue #62)

CHANGED: Excluded tabular inlines from jQuery tabs, as they are currently
         not supported.
CHANGED: Use app-level translation files in favour of a single project-level
         one. Adds an autoregister feature similiar to the one provided by
         Django's admin. A new setting MODELTRANSLATION_TRANSLATION_FILES keeps
         backwards compatibility with older versions. See documentation for
         details. This is basically a merge from both
         django-modeltranslation-wrapper and hyperweek's branch at github.
         (thanks to Jacek Tomaszewski, Sébastien Fievet and Maxime Haineault,
          resolves issues #19, #58 and #71)
CHANGED: Moved tests to separate folder and added tests for TranslationAdmin.
         To run the tests the settings provided in model.tests.modeltranslation
         have to be used (settings.LANGUAGES override doesn't work for
         TranslationAdmin).
CHANGED: Major refactoring of the admin integration. Subclassed BaseModelAdmin
         and InlineModelAdmin. Patching options in init doesn't seem to be
         thread safe. Instead used provided hooks like get_form, get_formset
         and get_fieldsets. This should resolve several problems with the
         exclude and fieldsets options and properly support options in inlines.
         (resolves issue #72)

  FIXED: Non-unicode verbose field names showing up empty in forms.
         (resolves issue #35)
  FIXED: Dynamic TranslationOptions model name.
  FIXED: Widgets for translated fields are not properly copied from original
         fields.
         (thanks to boris-chervenkov, resolves issue #74)
  FIXED: Removed XMLField test which is deprecated since Django 1.3 and
         broke tests in Django 1.4.
         (resolves issue #75)


v0.3.3
======
Date: 2012-02-23
Packaged from revision 129.

CHANGED: jQuery search path in tabbed_translation_fields.js. This allows use of
         a version of jQuery other than the one provided by Django. Users who
         want to force the use of Django's jQuery can include force_jquery.js.

  FIXED: Another attempt to include static files during installation.
         (resolves reopened issue #61)


v0.3.2
======
Date: 2011-06-16
Packaged from revision 122.

  FIXED: Static files not included during installation.
         (resolves issue #61)

         original field.
         (resolves issue #47)
  FIXED: In some setups appears "This field is required" error for the
         original field.
         (resolves issue #5)
  FIXED: Translations are not saved for tinymce HTMLField when using jquery
         tabs.

         (thanks to carl.j.meyer, resolves issue #25)
  FIXED: Verbose names of translated fields are not translated.
         (thanks to carl.j.meyer, resolves issue #24)
